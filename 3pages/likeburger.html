Taste is important. Even if you force yourself to eat a salad that tastes like dirt, you are just teaching your head to dislike salads. Anything you eat has to be tasty and you need to look forward to eating the food again. A burger will do that, a salad most often won’t.

   <li>They don’t need unhealthy toppings</li>

A good burger tastes great as it is. Salads, especially those fast-food ones, need dressings and toppings to be acceptable. Dressings are very often pre-made and full of sugar, refined oils, and chemicals. Also, popular toppings don’t sound too healthy – oil soaked bread crumbs, tortilla chips, bacon, fried onions, and candied fruits.

   <li>They are filling</li>

A good burger gives you plenty of energy, protein and a lot of fibre; all of these help you feel satiated. Salads do contain a lot of vegetables that carry vitamins, minerals, and fibre. But the problem is they often lack overall energy and protein. There’s no point eating a healthy salad if it leaves you hungry and looking for candy to fill up.

   <li>They are just names</li>
<p>
A burger made with grass-fed organic beef, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a Portobello mushroom instead of a bun is a nutritious and healthy food. Similarly, a salad with plenty of veggies, pieces of fish, avocado, nuts, and olive oil is very filling, tasty, and nutritious too.
