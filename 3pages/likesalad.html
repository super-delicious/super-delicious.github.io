   <li>Think bright and dark</li>
<p>
Brightly colored vegetables and darker-colored greens are nutritional powerhouses. Skip the pale iceberg, and double your fiber with fresh spinach or romaine, instead.
</p>
   <li>Avoid meats and cheeses</li>
<p>
Remember, it's a salad, not a sandwich. You can add protein by sprinkling on small amounts of nuts and seeds (they're high in calories, so a sprinkle is plenty), garbanzo beans or quinoa. If you do want to add a little meat now and then, use grilled chicken or fish rather than fried or processed meat. And if you're watching your waist, keep an eye on the cheese, or better yet, leave it off entirely.

   <li>Dress it down</li>
<p>
Don't sabotage your healthy, low-calorie salad by swamping it in creamy, high-fat dressing. Find a fat-free or low-calorie dressing that you like instead, and request low-cal dressings in restaurants. This can reduce the calories and fat in your salad by up to 80 percent, saving you 1,000 calories or more per week.
</p>
   <li>Dress with less</li>
<p>
It's handy that bottled salad dressings list the calories and grams of fat per tablespoon, but when was the last time you measured out your dressing? Chances are good that you're using more than that. To cut the amount of dressing that you use by about two-thirds, have your dressing on the side, and dip your fork into the dressing before you grab each bite of salad. You'll get dressing in every bite, but a lot less of it overall.
</p>
   <li>Dress it up</li>
<p>
Adding grapes, orange or grapefruit segments, peaches, pears, apricots or apple slices to your salads will boost the flavor so much that you won't even need – or miss – a high-calorie dressing.
