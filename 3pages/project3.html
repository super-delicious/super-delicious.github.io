<h1>Cooking Vs. Eating out</h1>
<img src="cvse.jpg" alt="Cooking Vs. Eating out">
<hr>
<p>While many restaurants and fast food outlets offer us convincing marketing statements that they offer healthy and nutritional food, studies frequently find that this isn’t the case.

The sugar and sodium content of most processed foods cause them to be serious threats to our health. These are also the same qualities which allow these foods to become addictive.

It’s not just fast food, either.

The restaurant industry encourages overconsumption and indulgence in foods that we know to be unhealthy for our bodies.

Nor is restaurant food as healthy for us as what we would make at home.

At the same time, the cost of eating out puts a large strain on many of our food budgets.</P>

<h2>Health Benefits of Eating at Home</h2>

<ul>
	<strong><li>Healthier Ingredients and Methods</li></strong>
<p>
Restaurants and prepared food often incorporate more fats, sugars, and sodium than we would normally use when cooking for ourselves. Cooking at home allows you to add only as much as you think you should, while also allowing you to use healthier sugar and fat alternatives.

	<strong><li>It’s Easier to Avoid Food Allergies</li></strong>
<p>
Food allergies can cause unpleasant and even dangerous experiences, including hives and rashes, swelling, and possible asphyxiation. Common food allergies include shellfish, tree nuts, lactose intolerance, and gluten intolerance.

For those with allergies, you may not be able to tell if your food is likely to come into contact with something that you’re allergic to in a restaurant. Even when you do ask, many restaurant kitchens aren’t equipped to properly substitute for or isolate your food from every allergen.
	<strong><li>Portion Control</li></strong>
<p>
Restaurant portions are often more than our bodies need to be satisfied. Sometimes when we’re enjoying our meals, it can be tempting to finish a large portion, even when that means over-eating. Eating at home means serving yourself only the portions that you know you need.
</p>
	<strong><li>Enjoying a More Balanced Diet</li></strong>
<p>
Planning your own meals gives you the opportunity to have a more nutritionally balanced diet.Many prepared meals, such as fast foods chains, restaurants, and freezer meals, rely on filling you up and appeasing your taste buds with carbs, sugars, and sodium. Additionally, restaurants price side salads and vegetables at a premium.

Fortunately, when you’re cooking at home, salads and vegetable sides can be very inexpensive and quick additions to balance out your meal.
</p>
	<strong><li> Reduced Germ Exposure</li></strong>
<p>
Keeping your kitchen clean means protecting yourself from germs and contagions. You never know how clean a restaurant’s kitchen really is. This also means that you have complete control to cook your food thoroughly to prevent potential issues.
