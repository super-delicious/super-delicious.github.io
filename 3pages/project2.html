	<strong><li>How much you eat matters</li></strong>
<p>
people often want to classify food as healthy or unhealthy without taking into account that the amount matters. (Yes, people stereotype food too.) All three frozen treats have nutritional benefits such as providing protein, calcium, phosphorous, potassium and B vitamins. The protein could even help you feel fuller so that you eat less in general. As with nearly everything in life, the key is moderation. Including broccoli in your diet can be good. Filling your bed with broccoli, not so good.

	<strong><li>It's how you make it</li></strong>
<p>
The numbers in the tables above are averages. Different people will make food items differently. Putting in twice as much sugar in any of these could drastically change the rankings. So could adding more or less cream and air. Gourmet ice creams tend to have less air (closer to 25%) while discount ice creams tend to have more air...up to 90%. Because when ice cream has 100% air, it is no longer ice cream. It is air. And it would be a shame if you had paid for it, because you would have paid for air. Moreover, ice cream needs to have at least 10% milk fat to qualify as ice cream.

	<strong><li>The additions make a big difference</li></strong>
<p>
The least healthy part of this chilled trio may be the added ingredients. Like people, ice cream, gelato and frozen yogurt range from simple and real to completely artificial, depending on what ingredients are added to enhance texture, appearance, taste and storage-ability, ranging from starch, eggs and alcohol to guar gum and carrageenan to corn syrup to artificial flavors, colors and other ingredients. Think of these ingredients like plastic surgery. The more you add, the less ice cream, gelato and frozen yogurt remain true ice cream, gelato and frozen yogurt. Imagine if you added calcium sulfate, Polysorbate 80, magnesium hydroxide, high fructose corn syrup, propylene glycol alginate and E129 FD&C Red No. 40 to broccoli. Would broccoli be nearly as healthy anymore?
