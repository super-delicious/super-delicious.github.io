        <h2 class="myH2">Artist Statement</h2><br>
        <p class="myP"> Hello, my name is Yixin Cao and I am a graduating student majoring in studio practice at San Jose State University. During my college year, I am used to utilizing various kinds of techniques and tools to express ideas and emotions artistically. I explored various mediums such as Maya, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Touch Designer, and Coding.    
           <br> I was raised in Zhejiang, China, and moved to Riverside, CA, USA. I developed my curiosity in art in my childhood. After high school graduation, I attended the China Academy of Art College, my favorite art college in my hometown. I majored in 3D animation for two years, learned about character design, animated character, digital drawing, and history of animation.  
            After that, I started my colorful college at Norco College and Riverside City College. Since then, I have been studying my beloved studio art major here. As time goes on, I have found my academic interest: painting, figure drawing, and sculpting. In addition, I motivated myself to try different media. Up to now, I get used to various media features and surfaces, such as acrylic, oil, watercolor, gouache, etc.       
            <br>I transferred to San Jose State University, majoring in the studio practice program. However, I found my significant interest in Digital Media Arts from taking the ART74 and ART75 classes last semester. Through experimental video, virtual and augmented reality art, I explored gender discrimination, identity, culture conflict, and eco-awareness. To overcome these issues, I spent lots of effort creating narratives and atmospheres of the digital space and building a virtual realm to examine our reality. I believe digital media artworks bring the audience sense of interaction and empathy, though it is a virtual reality environment. 
            <br>For example, I made 3d modeling in Maya, "Social Distance Shelter," sri-fi's desolate scenery. Building a 3D scanning human modeling inside a protection device appeals to people's awareness of environmental protection and enables the audience to realize the importance of each individual to society. 
            <br> I am also a good listener and willing to cooperate with co-workers and take the essence and make a comprehensive summary and decision. I am currently pursuing a BFA in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. I look forward to the opportunity to learn and grow as a Digital Media Art student, a future artist mainly engaged in the digital art field and with industry-standard tools and techniques, and a member of the community.
